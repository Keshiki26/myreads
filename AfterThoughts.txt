After thoughts:
Stuff used to build this app - 
    Semantic UI (css + react components for styling)
    React Router:
        -Two Page management
        -HashRouter, Link and Route for links management
    BooksAPI:
        -So that data stays even after refresh
    Github Pages for deployment

Components -
    CurrentPage(Badly Named):
        -Essentially takes in an array of book object and title (and some callback functions etc)
        -I used this to display the three stages of books in the main page and I used it to display
         it in the search bar as well
        -So basically main page looked like this <Component /> * 3 to display everything. While the search bar had one
        -This was great because I didn't have to recode the stages of books 3 times or recode a new display for the search bar
        -I could just reuse this again and again
        -The only changes would be props, callback functions so information can be shared between parent/child/siblings
    Other Components - same as above, CurrentPage was just the main component that basically rendered mostly all UI needed for this page.

Good things I did -
    Spent a good amount of time designing the page and thinking about the logic of information control between parents, siblings, and children
    Spent a good amount of time trying to make sure to have controlled react elements
    Started from the bottom up - got the basics right first and the static look of the page then worked to the dynamic aspects
    One page at a time - worked on one page - finished and then worked on the next


Improvments - 
    Could have styled more myself - gotten better at CSS too or learned more about Semantic UI
    Studied React Router a little bit more
